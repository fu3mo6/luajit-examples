--- call a function with a repeat count argument.
-- Takes a single argument, which is a function which in turn takes one argument,
-- a repeat count.  The function is called with increasingly large repeat counts
-- until it takes at least a certain amount of time to run, and is then called four
-- more times with the same repeat count, with the minimum elapsed time recorded.
-- Modeled loosely on Python's timeit, except the function passed in is responsible
-- for doing the actual repetition.
